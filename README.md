# quaternions_acse
__________________
  
An example implementation of quaternions in python

This is principally for use as an example template of a python project for the Applied Computational Science and Engineering MSc course in the [Department of Earth Science & Engineering](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/earth-science) at [Imperial College London](http://imperial.ac.uk). Those looking for a canonical implementation should look elsewhere.
